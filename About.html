           Tribes such as the Koli, Hali, Dagi, Dhaugri, Dasa, Khasa, Kanaura, and Kirata inhabited the region from the prehistoric era. The foothills of the modern state of Himachal Pradesh were inhabited by people from the Indus valley civilisation which flourished between 2250 and 1750 BCE. The Kols and Mundas are believed to be the original inhabitants to the hills of present-day Himachal Pradesh followed by the Bhotas and Kiratas.
   During the Vedic period, several small republics known as Janapada existed which were later conquered by the Gupta Empire. 
   After a brief period of supremacy by King Harshavardhana, the region was divided into several local powers headed by chieftains, including some Rajputs principalities. 
   These kingdoms enjoyed a large degree of independence and were invaded by Delhi Sultanate a number of times. Mahmud Ghaznavi conquered Kangra at the beginning of the 11th century. 
   Timur and Sikander Lodi also marched through the lower hills of the state and captured a number of forts and fought many battles.
   Several hill states acknowledged Mughal suzerainty and paid regular tribute to the Mughals.
